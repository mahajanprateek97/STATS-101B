Professor: Akram Almohalwas 

Quarter: Spring 2019

In this class, we studied about the fundamentals of collecting data, including components of experiments, randomization and blocking, completely randomized design and ANOVA, multiple comparisons, power and sample size, and block designs.

Final Group Project
For our final project, we conducted a study to determine whether Cannabis Tea, Alcohol, or Music were effective stimulants for the levels of Endorphin. For this, we created a two factorial randomized block design to help us create an analysis of the effects of the aforementioned substances on participants from the open-ended virtual environment named Island.
